  The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist & hellip;the WWI Soldier & rsquo;s Watch with its elegant, protective grill & hellip;the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case & hellip;the innovative 1950 & rsquo;s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics & hellip;the Movado Artist & rsquo;s Series by luminaries of the fine art world & hellip;and the Movado Museum & reg; Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt & rsquo;s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond & trade; jewelry collection, Movado & rsquo;s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.Excellence in design.

  The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.  Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum Watch with its legendary dial.  Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.  The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.  Excellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881.

He called his company Movado, a word which means, roughly, ""always in motion."" The company grew and prospered, evolving from a small pocket watch manufacturer into a leading innovator and designer of precision wristwatches. Throughout its history, Movado has maintained its place at the pinnacle of innovation and excellence in design, craftsmanship and technology. Movado watches are crafted by highly-skilled watchmakers to meet the exacting standards of Swiss time technology. They are accurate to within seconds a year. All Movado watches are sealed and protected against water, moisture and dust, and individually tested to meet strict international standards of quality. A long-time dedicated supporter of the arts, Movado has, itself, been the recipient of over 200 international awards.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.  Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum Watch with its legendary dial.  Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.  The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.  Excellence in design.

It has stick hands with a stainless steel case and a rubber strap. Swiss Quartz movement   The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.Excellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.Excellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881. Swiss made and water resistant, all Movado watches are distinguished by a legacy of design innovation and dedication to the future of time. Discover the complete collection today.

In signature Movado style, the single dot at the 12 o' clock position plays brilliantly against a black backdrop of the dark dial and black leather band. An upscale watch that adds without subtracting, spring for this Movado. The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology. Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist. the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill. the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case. the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics. the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world. and the Movado Museum Watch with its legendary dial. Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces. The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.  Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum Watch with its legendary dial.  Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.Excellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881.

Always in motion, Movado creates modern watches of exceptional craftsmanship and design distinction.   Movado The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.  Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum Watch with its legendary dial.  Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.  The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.  Excellence in design.

  The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.Excellence in design.
