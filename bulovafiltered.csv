In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesOne of the world’s most accurate movements – accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and bracelet with black ion-plated accentsCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, grey, and silver dialRed continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCurved calendar windowScrew-back caseScrew-down crownDouble-press fold-over clasp with safety lockWater resistant to 300 metersAbout BulovaIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic™ nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 100 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.

Boxed set with pendant in stainless steel with 123 crystals from individually hand set on silver-tone case, bracelet and heart-shaped pendant, white mother-of-pearl dial, flat mineral glass, and jewelry clasp closure.   In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic™ nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 100 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.

  In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

Now Bulova makes history again with the special edition Lunar Pilot Chronograph. Features stainless steel screw-back case in silver-tone finish and black dial and sapphire glass.   From the Precisionist Collection. Featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist accuracy, this advanced chronograph offers 1/1,000-second precision over a twelve-hour time frame, with accuracy to within seconds a year. In stainless steel with curved crystal, multiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue, silver and black dial, chronograph measurement of hours, minutes, seconds, 1/10-seconds, 1/100-seconds and 1/1,000-seconds, yellow continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hour and minute hands, luminous markers, tachymeter, calendar, screw-back case, screw-down crown, double-press fold-over clasp with safety lock, and water resistance to 50 meters.Providing an extraordinary level of timing accuracy, the Bulova Precisionist Chronograph is the only chronograph to combine stopwatch timing to 1/1,000-second with Bulova’s exclusive Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, proven in laboratory testing to be one of the world’s most accurate.Easy and logical to read, each style features four subdials to display the cumulative time at a single glance, with individual measurements on the combined 1/10- and 1/100-second counter, as well as the hour and minute dials, dual-duty floating second hand, and a distinctive 1/1,000-second track with retrograde indicator.Precisionist TechnologyAt the heart of the watch is the Bulova Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, custom-engineered to provide accuracy to within seconds a year using a three-prong quartz crystal that creates a vibration frequency of 262.144 kHz, the highest of any watch in the world and far greater than that of a standard quartz crystal. In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesPrecision timing to 1/1,000th of a second12-hour chronograph functionOne of the world’s most accurate movements – accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and braceletSapphire GlassMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue and silver dialYellow continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCalendar windowTachymeterScrew-backScrew-down crownWater resistant to 50 metersAbout BulovaIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 50 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.

Now Bulova makes history again with the special edition Lunar Pilot Chronograph, updated with our exclusive high performance quartz movement with a frequency of 262 kHz for unparalleled accuracy, continuing a history of precision timing.   From the Precisionist Collection. Featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist accuracy, this advanced chronograph offers 1/1,000-second precision over a twelve-hour time frame, with accuracy to within seconds a year. In stainless steel with curved crystal, multiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue, silver and black dial, chronograph measurement of hours, minutes, seconds, 1/10-seconds, 1/100-seconds and 1/1,000-seconds, yellow continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hour and minute hands, luminous markers, tachymeter, calendar, screw-back case, screw-down crown, double-press fold-over clasp with safety lock, and water resistance to 300 meters.Providing an extraordinary level of timing accuracy, the Bulova Precisionist Chronograph is the only chronograph to combine stopwatch timing to 1/1,000-second with Bulova’s exclusive Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, proven in laboratory testing to be one of the world’s most accurate.Easy and logical to read, each style features four subdials to display the cumulative time at a single glance, with individual measurements on the combined 1/10- and 1/100-second counter, as well as the hour and minute dials, dual-duty floating second hand, and a distinctive 1/1,000-second track with retrograde indicator.Precisionist TechnologyAt the heart of the watch is the Bulova Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, custom-engineered to provide accuracy to within seconds a year using a three-prong quartz crystal that creates a vibration frequency of 262.144 kHz, the highest of any watch in the world and far greater than that of a standard quartz crystal. In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesPrecision timing to 1/1,000th of a second12-hour chronograph functionOne of the world’s most accurate movements – accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and braceletCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue and silver dialYellow continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCalendar windowTachymeterScrew-backScrew-down crownWater resistant to 300 metersAbout BulovaIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 100 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.

  In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements. An industry leader in diamond watch styling, with the new Diamond Gallery offering exquisite designs in stainless steel with sapphire crystals, Bulova is also known for Precisionist, featuring Bulova’s proprietary Precisionist-class quartz torsional resonator movement for accuracy to within seconds per year, the Marine Star collection, combining high-performance sports timekeeping with superior durability and water resistance to a minimum of 100 meters, and a comprehensive selection of classic styles, each with a three-year limited warranty.", Bulova , 98B152 , 98B152 , Round , Mineral , Analog , Buckle , Stainless Steel , 44.6 millimeters , 14.43 millimeters , Polyurethane , 24 millimeters , Black , Black , Stationary , Quartz , 300 Meters ,, no-metal-stamp , Stainless Steel ," Chronograph, Second Hand ", 9.44 Ounces , Mens-Standard , Date , Manufacturer’s warranty can be requested from customer service.

In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.", Bulova , 98H37 , 98H37 , Round , Mineral , Analog , Push-Button Clasp , Stainless Steel , 42 millimeters , 12 millimeters , Stainless Steel , 22 millimeters , Silver , Blue , Unidirectional , Quartz , 330 Feet ,, no-metal-stamp , Stainless Steel ," Chronograph,Second Hand,Water Resistant ", 5.76 Ounces , Mens Standard , Date , Manufacturer’s warranty can be requested from customer service.

Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data.

Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.   From the diamond collection.

Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic™ nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements.

In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesOne of the world’s most accurate movements – accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and bracelet with black ion-plated accentsCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, grey, and silver dialRed continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCurved calendar windowScrew-back caseScrew-down crownDouble-press fold-over clasp with safety lockWater resistant to 300 metersAbout BulovaIn 1875, Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant, set up shop in New York City and a legendary American watch brand was born. Since then, Bulova has stood proudly in the vanguard of timekeeping innovation, committed to the legacy of creativity and excellence established by its founder.A pioneering force in the industry, Bulova transformed how watches were worn and how time was perceived, registering over 50 patents as he and his company built a record of creativity including the first full lines of men’s (1919) and ladies’ (1924) wristwatches, the first clock/radio (1928) and the first electric clock (1931). To ensure the utmost in precision, in 1920, Bulova even established its own observatory – located atop its New York skyscraper. With that same spirit of innovation, following World War II, determined “to serve those who served us,” Bulova established The Bulova School of Watchmaking, using new and unique methods to train disabled veterans for positions in the watch and jewelry industry. Then, in 1960, Bulova changed timekeeping forever with the revolutionary Accutron, the world’s first fully electronic watch. An integral component of U.S. space technology, Accutron timing was used on 46 NASA missions, including Apollo XI, the first lunar landing (1969).Today, as one of the world’s most recognized brands, Bulova has expanded across the globe, with four separate watch brands, Bulova, Bulova AccuSwiss, Bulova Accutron II and Caravelle New York, as well as the award-winning Bulova Clocks.The signature Bulova brand provides an extensive selection of watches for every occasion, crafted of the finest materials, including 315L surgical grade stainless steel, diamonds, mother-of-pearl, carbon fiber, top-quality leather and Bulova’s proprietary Duramic™ nylon/ceramic composite, and powered by Precisionist-class quartz, automatic and quartz movements.

  In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

  In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch. Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams. Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.
